3 physical nics
	1) Lan wired  --- only this NIC is hyver-v switch enabled
	2) Wifi inbuilt in motherboard
	3) External NIC connected via USB


I created 3 bridges. Therefore, total 4 bridges including default created by system, which is for natting and it uses default swtich. D
During installation, system auto selects which physicl nic the default switch gonna listen on. In my case, it is internal (wifi build in motherboad) nic

Now, I have two more physical NICs. Although, I can also use internal (wifi built in motherboard) nic too, because system allows to share to management OS.

I created external hyper-v switch and make it listen on Lan wired nic. 

I also created internal and private virtual switches. They don't listen to nobody. 

I put external virtual switch and internal virtual switch connected via the same virtual bridge. 

Lan wired nic ---- external switch ---- bridge --- internal switch ---- inside VM guest system (Vmnic2)     Note: VMnic means virtual machine nic
Wifi inbuilt in motherboard -- nat -- default virtual switch -- inside VM guest system (Vmnic1)




External NIC connected via USB is kind of useless (more than needed to me)


Only with LAN wired NIC, I (as host machine) can't access internet. But my virtual machines can access if they used via this 
Lan wired nic ---- external switch ---- bridge --- internal switch ---- inside VM guest system (Vmnic2)

With ifi inbuilt in motherboard, I can connect both host and guest systems. 


With external NIC connected via usb, I can only connect guest to the internet.
